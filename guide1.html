        <h2 id="A1">Starting in Nuvema Town!</h2>
            <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="img/snivy.png" alt=Snivy><img src="img/tepig.png" alt=Tepig><img src="img/oshawott.png" alt=Oshawott></p>
            <p>If I had to rank the Unovan starters, I would, in order of best to not so best, go with:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Tepig - Great offense and hit points, bad defences and speed. It's the only one of the three to gain a secondary typing and is the preferred starter for speedrunners.</li>
                <li>Oshawott - A jack of all trades, the balanced starter. Its worst stats are in special fefence and speed while its best is in special attack and physical attack.</li>
                <li>Snivy - It's fast and has good defences, but it has a rather limited movepool. Recommended for a slight challenge.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Now most people will say that the Nuzlocke rules don't apply yet until you obtain Pokéballs. If I lose in these first two battles with Bianca and Cheren, I won't count it because you can't prepare for these fights and it's basically up to chance whatever you win or not. You should try to win; an extra 1000 Pokédollars is really helpful.</p>
            <p>After you talk to your mom, go to the house in the bottom-left. After that cutscene, go north and talk to Cheren. The Professor will explain about the Pokédex and will allow to nickname your starter.</p>
        <h2 id="A2">The First Route</h2>
            <p><img src="img/r1potion.png" style="float: right; max-width: 25%; padding: 5px 15px;">After Juniper teaches how to catch Pokémon, you are then given 5 Pokéballs. You have an equal chance of finding either a Patrat or Lillipup. Talk to the girl in the patch of grass to get a Potion.</p>
        <h2 id="A3">A Mysterious Trainer?</h2>
            <p>You can do this anytime, but don't forget to talk to the man on the second floor of the top-left building to get a free Pokéball. When you're able to buy some items, buy Pokéballs in bunches of 10 to get a free Premier Ball. You can buy more types of items when you get gym badges. Go outside and towards that crowd or head back down to Route 1 for some training if you don't feel you're ready. A Lv.7 starter should easily beat <a href="trainer.html#n1">N's Purrloin.</a></p>

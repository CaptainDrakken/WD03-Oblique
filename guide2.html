        <h2 id="A4">Hurrah for Running Shoes!</h2>
            <p>Your mom shows up with a gift; running shoes! Now you don't have to slowly walk everywhere. In that grass, you can find Purrloin, Patrat, and Lillipup. Due to how experience calculation works in these games, I'm going to suggest not training the Pokémon you've caught (unless it's a Lv.7 Lillipup or Patrat) until after you beat the first Gym. If you don't want to spend a long time grinding, I would make sure all the trainer experience goes to your starter or an upcoming Gift Pokémon. Even if that doesn't bother you, there's one Pokémon I don't recommend training; Purrloin <i>sucks</i> to fight anything with until it evolves because it's weak and doesn't learn a STAB move until <i>Lv.15</i>. There's a better way to train one right after you beat the first Gym anyway.</p>
            <p>Don't underestimate the Youngsters here; a 50 power Tackle from a Lillipup or Patrat can be scary. You don't want to lose your starter this early on. There's a few items to get to the right of the second Youngster. <b>Do not forget to heal up your Pokémon before heading north.</b> You will fight <a href="trainer.html#bianca2">Bianca</a> who now has a Lillipup alongside her starter. This fight shouldn't pose a problem as long you're in good condition before hand.</p>
        <h2 id="A5">Monkey See Monkey Don't</h2>
            <p>There's quite a number of items to obtain here.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Bottom of the city, under the railing at the end, collect X Speed.</li>
                <li>Bottom-right building, talk to man to get a Great Ball.</li>
                <li>Go behind that building to talk to a Roughneck and receive a Dusk Ball.</li>
                <li>Walk left of the city to a garden and down the bottom bridge to get another Great Ball.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Instead of heading into the school, go east to the Dreamyard. You will have to fight 2 trainers to talk to the girl who will give you one of the Elemental Monkeys: Panpour, Pansage, and Pansear. Depending on your starter, it will be the type weak to your starter but strong against the Gym. Don't forget to collect the X Defend nearby. You should be using your monkey for the rest of the fights in this section becuase it needs more experience to level up.</p>
        <h2 id="A6">Three Stand Together as One!</h2>
            <p>Go back to Striaton City because it's time to go to school. Talk to the boy in the vest to take a quiz. Get the answers right; get a Full Heal! Now it's time to <a href="trainer.html#cheren2">face Cheren</a>.</p>
            <p>Cheren's the first trainer to use a held item for his Pokémon. Your monkey should clean this fight up. You're then rewarded with some Oran Berries. There's not a good way to get berries in this game so equip them right before the Gym battle. Go outside and you'll see a green-haired fellow in the doorway of the Gym. He'll introduce himself as Cilan and let you inside.</p>
            <p>A man named Clyde will interupt and give you a Fresh Water. Everytime you get to a Gym, you should talk to him to get another Fresh Water if he doesn't talk to you first. The Gym puzzle here is very simple; just step on the button with the type that is super effective on the type on the curtain. You will need to fight 2 Gym trainers before the boss fight. Don't be careless; I've' actually lost my starter here before.</p>
            <p>The Gym Leaders will reveal themselves as a trio: <a href="trainer.html#chili">Chili</a>, <a href="trainer.html#cress">Cress</a>, and <a href="trainer.html#cilan">Cilan</a>. You will fight the one that is strong against your starter. Use your starter for the Lillipup and use your monkey on his monkey. Win the battle and GET! the Trio Badge and TM Work Up.</p>

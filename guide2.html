        <h2 id="A4">Hurrah for Running Shoes!</h2>
            <p>Your mom shows up with a gift; running shoes! Now you don't have to slowly walk everywhere. In that grass, you can find Purrloin, Patrat, and Lillipup. Due to how experience calculation works in these games, I'm going to suggest not training the Pokémon you've caught (unless it's a Lv.7 Lillipup or Patrat) until after you beat the first Gym. If you don't want to spend a long time grinding, I would make sure all the trainer experience goes to your starter or an upcoming Gift Pokémon. Even if that doesn't bother you, there's one Pokémon I don't recommend training; Purrloin <i>sucks</i> to fight anything with until it evolves because it's weak and doesn't learn a STAB move until <i>Lv.15</i>. There's a better way to train one right after you beat the first Gym anyway.</p>
            <p>Don't underestimate the Youngsters here; a 50 power Tackle from a Lillipup or Patrat can be scary. You don't want to lose your starter this early on. There's a few items to get to the right of the second Youngster. <b>Do not forget to heal up your Pokémon before heading north.</b> You will fight <a href="trainer.html#bianca2">Bianca</a> who now has a Lillipup alongside her starter. This fight shouldn't pose a problem as long you're in good condition before hand.</p>
        <h2 id="A5">Monkey See Monkey Don't</h2>
            <p>There's quite a number of items to obtain here.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Bottom of the city, under the railing at the end, collect X Speed.</li>
                <li>Bottom-right building, talk to man to get a Great Ball.</li>
                <li>Go behind that building to talk to a Roughneck and receive a Dusk Ball.</li>
                <li>Walk left of the city to a garden and down the bottom bridge to get another Great Ball.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Instead of heading into the school, go east to the Dreamyard.</p>

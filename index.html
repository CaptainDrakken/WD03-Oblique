        <h2>What is a Pokemon nuzlocke?</h2>
        <p>A nuzlocke is a self-imposed challenge meant to increase the difficulty of a Pokemon game. It has a few main simple rules:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>You can only catch the first wild Pokemon you find in each area and if you fail to catch it, you don’t get a second chance.</li>
            <li>If a Pokemon faints, it is considered “dead” and is permanently unusable.</li>
            <li>Give every Pokemon you get a name. It’s supposed to make you more attached to them.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>There are plenty of additional rules you can add to increase or decrease the difficulty of the challenge but for this guide, the only extra rule I will assume you’re using is:</p>
        <p>Species/Dupes Clause - You may ignore the first encounter in an area and try again if the Pokemon encountered is one you already obtained. For example, if you find a Pikachu first but you already caught one, you can run around until you find a Pokemon you haven't caught.</p>
        <p>The game I will be going over is Pokemon Black and White for the Nintendo DS. I’m going to assume you know the basics of Pokemon because no one would try this if they didn’t know anything about these games.</p>
